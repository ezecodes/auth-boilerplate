## Key Features

### Authentication and Authorization

Buildkit includes robust authentication and authorization features to ensure secure access control for your application. It includes features such as:

- Sign-in
- Reset password
- Signup
- Google sign-in and signup

### Database Support

Buildkit seamlessly integrates with multiple databases, providing support for efficient data storage and retrieval. It supports:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- MariaDB

### Email Sending

Buildkit includes email sending capabilities, making it easy to implement email functionality in your application.

### Image Upload

Buildkit offers seamless integration with AWS S3 buckets for efficient image upload and retrieval.
To utilize the image upload feature:

- #### Setup AWS S3 Bucket
  Create an AWS S3 bucket, and a directory within the bucket to store your images. Note down the bucket name, access keys and the name of the directory.
- #### Configure AWS Credentials:
  Add your AWS access keys to your environment variables in the `.env` file.
- #### Update Config File:
  Add your bucket name and image upload directory to the `server/config/aws.js` file. You can also modify the region found in the config file if it varies from yours.

### Logging

Buildkit's logging system is dynamic, allowing you to choose between logging to the console or to a file. In production, you can either log to the console for console logging or to a file for file logging. This ensures that you can easily manage and track your application's logs for debugging and monitoring purposes.

### CSS Styling

For styling, Buildkit utilizes Tailwind CSS along with vanilla CSS. This combination provides a powerful yet straightforward way to design your application's user interface.

### View Rendering

Buildkit supports multiple view rendering engines, including EJS and React, to provide flexibility in building your frontend. You can find ready-made starter templates in the `views` folder.

### Webpack Integration

Buildkit integrates Webpack for efficient bundling of React components, ensuring a streamlined development process.

```

### Setting Up Environment Variables

Start by creating a new file named `.env` in the root directory of your project. Copy the contents from `.env.sample` into this new file. Update the variables in the `.env` file to match your local environment settings.

### Setting Up and Spinning Up a Database

Buildkit supports multiple databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MariaDB. Install and set up your preferred database system on your local machine. Update the database dialect in the `server/config/index.js` file to match your choice of database.

### Installing Packages

All packages for this project can be found in the `package.json` file. Run `npm install` to install packages from the npm repository.

### Understanding `package.json` Scripts

The `package.json` file contains scripts that automate various tasks in your project. Here are the key scripts:

- `start`: Starts the server in production mode.
- `css`: Watches for changes in CSS files and compiles them using Tailwind CSS.
- `dev`: Starts the server in development mode using nodemon.
- `webpack:dev`: Compiles JSX files using webpack in development mode.
- `webpack:prod`: Compiles JSX files using webpack in production mode.
- `all`: Runs the server, watches CSS files, and compiles JSX files concurrently in development mode.

For example, to start the development server along with CSS and JSX compilation, you can run:

```sh
npm run all
```

### Is there an available frontend page already built?

Yes. The Authentication pages are already built. You can find them in the `/views` and `/react` directories of the root directory.
